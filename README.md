**S**atisfactory **M**ap **R**epository **A**pplication **P**rogramming **I**nterface **R**eference **I**mplementation

## Purpose

This code serves as the reference implementation of the SMR API.

The code should make it easy for programmers to build their product on top of the SMR API.

## Safety

Being a reference implementation,
this code doesn't tries to catch all possible exceptions and validating all input.
It merely focuses on making the requests properly to demonstrate how it's done.

## Help

The help for the API itsef can be found at https://cable.ayra.ch/satisfactory/maps/help/
